          <h2>Idea</h2>
          <p>
            The AP Computer Science exam is a programming on paper design,
            Google in person interview are on paper, and many other companies do
            hand written code exams. Yet there are no tools to help you prep for
            these exams. ICode helps you prepare for these tests by giving you
            coding problems, and allowing you to scan and run your handwritten
            code.

          <h2>Use Cases</h2>
          <p>
            As it stands, the only way to code is with a PC. 
            This has been the case for decades now and needs to be changed. 
            ICode introduces mobile coding, which uses just your phone and paper. 
            If you're ever out and about, you can still coding. If a laptop is 
            too expensize, you can still code. If you're grounded for spending all 
            your time coding and not taking out the trash and so you're locked in 
            your room with just your phone and paper, you can still code.
